CS613 - HW4 - Artificial Neural Networks
========================================

Code for Drexel's CS613 HW4 assignment on Artificial Neural Networks

**Make sure to use x11 forwarding when sshing into TUX**
*The plotting library 'matplotlib' requires x11 to plot the graphs*

Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
All of the required python dependencies should already be available on tux. I have run this assignment
using python 2.7 (Same as is installed on tux), however if you intend to run this locally (not on tux), run 'make init'.
::$ make init

------------------
1) Part 1
::$ make part1

2) Part 2
::$ make part2

3) Part 3
